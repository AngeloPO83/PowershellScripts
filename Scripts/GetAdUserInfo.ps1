List Users in Active Directory â€“ PowerShell GUI Tool (2019)
Developed by Angelo Polatto.

Description:
  This script provides a GUI-based application to retrieve and display user information from Active Directory.
  It allows administrators to search for users by username, email, or display name and view detailed attributes including group memberships and account status.
  It also supports exporting the search results to CSV.

Requirements:
  - Active Directory module (RSAT-AD-PowerShell) must be installed.
  - The executing user must have the necessary permissions to query Active Directory.

Note:
  This project was developed as a study case to explore PowerShell GUI development, AD automation, and robust scripting practices.
  Feedback and suggestions for improvements are welcome.
