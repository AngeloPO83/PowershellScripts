 Developed in 2019 by Angelo Polatto using Powershell 3.0 supporting previous versions of Powershell.
 In summary this software performs a local copy of on screen selected file(s) found in a remote
 computer, preserving the remote three directory.
 
 As at the time this code was meant to be used in a joined domain computer, while executing this code 
 make sure that the current user has granted access permission on the remote computer.

 Note: as my intention is also demonstrate my evolution over time I decided to keep the code as it was,
 if any request or improved version is necessary, please let know.
